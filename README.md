# üìÅ FileSync - File sharing over a local network
<h3>
File Sync is a full-stack application that allows seamless file transfer between mobile and PC over the same network. I built it using React Native for the frontend and Flask for the backend.

What makes this project even more exciting is that most of the development was powered by AI tools like Rork AI and ChatGPT. With the right prompts, these AIs helped me build out the core functionality quickly and efficiently. Of course, there were a few hiccups along the way, but I was able to debug and fix them within minutes.

The entire project was up and running in just 60 minutes, showcasing how powerful and time-saving AI-assisted development can be‚Äîespecially when combined with strong problem-solving skills and the right tech stack.
